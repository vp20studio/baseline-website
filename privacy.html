            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 28, 2025</p>

            <p>
                This Privacy Policy describes how Baseline ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.
            </p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

            <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Baseline does not require account creation.</strong> You can use the App without providing any personal information such as your name, email address, or phone number.
            </p>

            <h3>Information Stored Locally on Your Device</h3>
            <p>
                All App data is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. This includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Challenge selections and custom rules you create</li>
                <li>Daily completion status and streak data</li>
                <li>Your commitment contract signature image</li>
                <li>App preferences and settings</li>
                <li>Notification preferences</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to our servers.</strong> We do not have access to, cannot view, and do not collect this information.
            </p>

            <h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>We do not collect any analytics, usage data, crash reports, or diagnostic information.</strong> Your activity within the App is completely private and is not tracked or monitored.
            </p>

            <h2>Subscription and Payment Information</h2>
            <p>
                Baseline offers optional premium subscriptions. All payment processing is handled entirely by Apple through the App Store. When you make a purchase:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Payment is processed by Apple:</strong> We never receive, process, or store your payment card details, billing address, or other financial information. Apple handles all payment processing in accordance with their <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>RevenueCat subscription management:</strong> We use RevenueCat to verify subscription status. RevenueCat receives only an anonymous, randomly-generated user identifier and your purchase history (subscription type, purchase date, renewal status). No personally identifiable information is shared with RevenueCat.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>
                The App integrates with the following third-party services:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Apple App Store:</strong> For app distribution and in-app purchase processing</li>
                <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> For subscription status verification (receives anonymous purchase data only)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We do not share any data with advertisers, data brokers, social networks, or any other third parties not listed above.
            </p>

            <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
            <p>
                We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information. Since we do not collect personal data, there is no personal data to share. The only data transmitted outside your device is:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anonymous subscription verification data to RevenueCat</li>
                <li>Purchase transactions processed by Apple</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
            <p>
                All your challenge data, progress, and settings are stored exclusively on your device. You have complete control over your data:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deleting the App</strong> permanently removes all associated data from your device</li>
                <li><strong>We retain no copies</strong> of your data on any servers</li>
                <li><strong>No backup to our servers</strong> — your data is not synced to any cloud service operated by us</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you use iCloud backup on your device, App data may be included in your device backup according to Apple's backup policies.
            </p>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>
                Because your data is stored locally on your device and not transmitted to us, it benefits from the security measures built into your iOS device, including device encryption and biometric protection (if enabled).
            </p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                The App is not directed to children under 13 years of age (or the applicable age of digital consent in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information to us, please contact us so we can address the concern.
            </p>

            <h2>International Users</h2>
            <p>
                The App is available internationally through the App Store. Since we do not collect or store personal data, there are no international data transfers of your personal information by us. Apple's processing of App Store transactions is subject to Apple's privacy policy and data processing practices.
            </p>

            <h2>Your Rights</h2>
            <p>
                Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your data, including rights under GDPR, CCPA, or other privacy laws. Because we do not collect personal data:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>There is no personal data for us to access, correct, or delete</li>
                <li>You can delete all App data by uninstalling the App</li>
                <li>You can manage your subscription through Apple's subscription settings</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>
                We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the App or on our website and updating the "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
            </p>
