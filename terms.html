            <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>
                Baseline is a personal accountability application designed to help users complete 30, 60, or 90-day challenges focused on building healthier habits and reducing dependency on constant stimulation. The App provides:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pre-built and customizable challenge templates</li>

                <strong>Important:</strong> The App is an accountability and tracking tool only. It does not block, restrict, or prevent access to any applications, websites, or content on your device. Your success depends entirely on your personal commitment and choices.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Subscription Terms</h2>
            <p>
                Baseline offers premium features through auto-renewing subscriptions. By subscribing, you agree to the following terms:
            </p>

            <h3>3.1 Subscription Options and Pricing</h3>

            </ul>
            <p>

            </p>

            <h3>3.2 Free Trial</h3>
            <p>
                New subscribers may be eligible for a <strong>7-day free trial</strong>. During the trial period, you have full access to premium features at no charge. If you do not cancel before the trial period ends, your subscription will automatically begin and you will be charged the applicable subscription fee.
            </p>

            <h3>3.3 Payment</h3>

            </p>

            <h3>3.4 Auto-Renewal</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period.</strong> Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the same rate you were originally charged.
            </p>

            <h3>3.5 Managing and Canceling Subscriptions</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>You can manage your subscription and turn off auto-renewal at any time</strong> by going to your Account Settings in the App Store after purchase. To cancel your subscription:
            </p>
            <ul>

            </p>

            <h3>3.6 Price Changes</h3>
